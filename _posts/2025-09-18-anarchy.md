# Anarchy in IR: No World Referee, Just Walls #

>Imagine a world where the only rule is: there is no rule

## What Is Anarchy?
Anarchy means that there's no overarching authority above states. No world government or supranational organisation to enforce rules or guarantee security. From this absence grows chronic uncertainty: you never know if others will honour agreements, remain peaceful, or suddenly turn hostile. And it is that uncertainty that pushes actors to prioritise survival, reputation, and self-help. But anarchy isn't a straight path to war or cooperation. Rather, it's the blank canvas of the world on which different logics paint very different pictures.

## Four Ways to See Anarchy
**1. Realist View**  
In the realist paradigm, when there's no global referee, states must look out for number one. What does it mean? That states must do what they think is best for themselves and always prioritise their interests over others'. And since you can't know whether or not your neighbour will decide to attack you, you have to arm yourself. But that's where the paradox resides. Because if you arm yourself to feel safe, at the same time those same weapons will alarm your neighbour who will also start to arm themselves. And then you're both engaged in a spiral of arms race: that's the security dilemma.

*Attack on Titan*, or *Shingeki no Kyojin* for purists, is a somewhat good illustration to grasp anarchy in the realist view. It dramatises the realist nightmare of anarchy. Indeed,the reader, or viewer depending on your preferred medium, is thrown into Eren's world of walls, fear, and militarised enclaves. The walled cities embody the sovereign state. Much like it, they are fortified, suspicious, and constantly preparing for the worst. Their leaders pour resources upon resources into militarisation. But it's not because they adore war. Rather, it's because survival demands it. The Titans are unpredictable so you need to be prepared to fend them off. But so too are rival human factions. Alliances collapse the moment trust falters. And preemptive strikes mirror the logic of deterrence and balancing: you must arm first, strike first, or risk annihilation. This cycle of fear and arms buildup is the security dilemma in animated form.


**2. Liberal View**  
Liberals also accept anarchy as the core concept, or the blank canvas as we said earlier, of international relations. But they believe that institutions, trade, and law can temper the worst impulses it ignites. Sharing information and creating rules are means to reduce uncertainty and make cooperation more attractive. If everyone adheres to the same rulebook and sticks to it, there shouldn't be any reason to fear a non-book move. 

In *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, the United Federation of Planets is an illustration of what a liberal view is lived in practice. It shows how institutions can tame anarchy's chaos. In a galaxy without a central authority, the Federation makes it not by brute force but by creating a dense web of treaties, councils, and shared norms. Starfleet captains act both as diplomats and as warriors, and they use negotiation and precedent to defuse crises. Even when they face hostile powers like the Klingons or Romulans, the Federation relies on dialogue and institutional memory to prevent every encounter from turning into a war. This is liberalism's wager: rules and repeated interaction can turn an anarchic void into a cooperative order. 


**3. Constructivist View**  
Constructivists insist that "anarchy is what states make of it". It means that behaviour may indeed be shaped by material forces, like weapons, but we mustn't forget the role of meanings, norms, and identities. Simply said, if you see your neighbour as a friend, you'll build ties with them. On the contrary, if you see them as a foe, you'll prepare for war.

*Neon Genesis Evangelion* illustrates this idea. The Angels are themselves a constant variable but their meaning attached to them diverges radically. For NERV, they are existential enemies that require militarised resistance. For SEELE, they are more like catalysts for a new human order. The clash isn't over material capabilities. Rather, it's about interpretation and identity. Misreadings and competing narratives escalate conflict more than weapons themselves. Constructivists would say that this shows how shared ideas, and not just firepower, script the behaviour of actors under anarchy.


**4. Critical & Postcolonial View**  
Critical scholars point out that when we talk about anarchy, we often assume "equal" sovereigns. But this masks deeper hierarchies of race, empire, or capital. Power persists in fact in invisible structures like finance, technology, or borders. And this cannot be erased by formal equality.

*Black Panther* flips the script with Wakanda. Wakanda appears weak and peripheral but secretly, it dominates through vibranium and advanced technology. Its isolationism is a blatant critique to how global structures of race and empire marginalise African states. On top of that, its hidden power exposes the uneven distribution of resources that underpins the system. *District 9* pushes further. It shows how even under UN oversight, legal frameworks can reproduce segregation and exploitation. Both stories reveal that anarchy is also structured by invisible legacies of colonialism, capitalism, and racial hierarchy. 


## Why It Matters
Fictional worlds let us feel the weight of anarchy in ways that theory alone can't teach us. *Attack on Titan* shows fear spiraling into arms races, *Star Trek* imagines institutions that make cooperation possible, *Evangelion* reminds us that meaning shapes conflict, and *Black Panther*, along with *District 9* expose the hidden hierarchies beneath the rhetoric of equality. Together, they reveal that anarchy is a lens rather than a verdict: sometimes it magnifies fear, sometimes it refracts cooperation, sometimes it distorts through identity, and sometimes it conceals domination. Pop culture makes visible what IR theories help us recognise: there is no single script for anarchy, only the stories we tell about it.
